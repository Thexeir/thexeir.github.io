***The Mithril Stormhammer***

*Weapon (warhammer), very rare*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

**Giant's Bane (Requires Attunement).** While you are attuned to this weapon and holding it, your Strength score increases by 4 and can exceed 20, but not 30. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a giant, the giant must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or die.

*Notes: Versatile*
