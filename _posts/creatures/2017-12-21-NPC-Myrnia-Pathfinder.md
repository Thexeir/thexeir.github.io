**Bio** Myrnia is just under 100 years of age, information she rarely shares with others. She earned her deed name during the War of Bones after she found a mountain pass that allowed her regiment of dwarven soldiers to get two ahead of an evlish caravan carrying weapons and supplies to the elvish front lines. She is what is known as a Stone-shifter, an ancient order of dwarven druids who use their powers to scout the wilderness and work stone. She was only in the war for a few years before it ended, but her superiors noted her skill and recommended her to Kazadar for the expedition. She is a skilled artist and has been tasked with helping map Kraddos.

**Physical Description** She is of average height for a dwarf, she wears her black hair in a low loose pony tail. She has golden colored eyes and tan skin. She wears fur clothing generally and keeps a small handaxe tucked away. She always seems to be clutching her druidic focus, a runed stone.

**Quirks** She has an oddly neutral accent (US Midwestern) and while jovial, speaks very little. It's rare to see her without a smile on her face.

**Dwarf (Ironheart) Druid, Level 8**
